Practice: Chemical Reactions
You will need to use a calculator and a periodic table to complete this activity.
1. Conditions around hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean floor can enable chemical reactions that produce solid materials. A student models one of these reactions by combining aqueous Ca(OH)2 and Na2SO4, and observes the formation of a solid in a liquid.
a. Justify the choice of a net ionic equation for describing this reaction. (2 points)
b. Write and balance a net ionic equation for the reaction. Show your original equation as well as 代 写2.1.7 Practice: Chemical ReactionsR
